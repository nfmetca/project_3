            <p class="aboutp">I am a junior at Illinois State University pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic
                Design. I am from Lake Zurich, Illinois, a town in the northwest suburb of Chicago. My entire life, I
                have always been interested in the arts. Outside of design, I enjoy yarn crafts such as knitting and
                crocheting. I mostly create wearables, but I dabble into other functional pieces as well. I am drawn to
                design because I strive to create things that are not only visually appealing but also functional and
                purposeful.</p>
